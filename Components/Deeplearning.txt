What is deep learning?
    A subset of Machine learning
        Machine learning: Turing things(data) into numbers and find patterns.
    Where as you give the data in traditional programing giving the inputs
    and rules to get and output

    Machine learning you give the inputs and the outputs and figure out the 
    relation ship between the data

Why use Machine learning
    While traditional won't fail machine learning can create solutions 
    without a consistant input
    I.E. 2+2 = 4 but also 2x2 = 4
    the same program cant solve both if given without context while machine
    learning can

    If you don't have to use ML DON'T!
